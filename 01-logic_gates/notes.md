# 01 Logic Gates

Maybe I want to explain the Nand Gate in the first week?

Otherwise this week is a way bigger project than the previous week.

## Boolean Algebra

Truth Table Representation

Boolean Expressions

Canonical Representation

## Gate Logic

Gate interface

Gate implementation

Primitive and Composite Gates

## Actual Hardware Construction

How can they send electrical input if they receive none? Where does it come from?

(All is connected to a power source?)

## Simulation

We have to be careful with the velocity of the electricity.

Each logic gates should only send output, when it has received signal from all its inputs.

Otherwise, the velocity of transmission increases in each logic gate we add and can become a problem.

If each logic gates sends the output once all inputs have received the signal, the velocity of transmissoin remains constant.
