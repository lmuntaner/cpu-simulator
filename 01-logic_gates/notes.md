# 01 Logic Gates

Maybe I want to explain the Nand Gate in the first week?

Otherwise this week is a way bigger project than the previous week.

## Boolean Algebra

Truth Table Representation

Boolean Expressions

Canonical Representation

## Gate Logic

Gate interface

Gate implementation

Primitive and Composite Gates

## Actual Hardware Construction

?

## Simulation



## Nand Gate

Truth Table
