# Circuit

## Electricity Simulation

### Power Source

### Lightbulb

### Electrical Node

Like a multiple socket that distributes electricity to many devices.

### Switch

## Notes

Separation of concerns. Do not mix UI and electric logic in the same class. Extend the electrical class.

Think of electrical current as messages sent regularly, not continuous.

There is no need to "reconnect" the wire back to the source, like in nomal electrical circuits for the source to work.
